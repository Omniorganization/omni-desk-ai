# Security Policy

## Supported Status

Current status: `1.12.3+root-monorepo-production-ga-candidate`.

This is a source-gated production GA candidate. It must not be represented as customer-distribution Production GA until external evidence gates pass against real systems.

## Required Controls

- Do not weaken approval, dual approval, sandbox, RBAC, CSP, webhook signatures, device signatures, audit logs, or external GA evidence gates.
- L2 and higher write/action capabilities require approval gating.
- L3 and L4 actions require human approval, auditability, timeout/revocation behavior, and rollback or containment evidence.
- Signed device requests are required for sensitive Desktop and Mobile runtime actions.
- Release artifacts must include portable checksums and release manifests.
- Customer-distribution releases require signed artifacts, SBOM/provenance, image digests, and real external evidence.

## Reporting

Do not include secrets, credentials, private keys, tokens, customer data, or production evidence payloads in public issues. Use a private security channel controlled by the repository owner.
